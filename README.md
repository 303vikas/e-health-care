The Mission of eHealth-Care is to help patients, physicians, and community hospitals to make appropriate use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in order to improve access and quality of healthcare delivery and reduce the cost of its management

My website provides you with a secure and easy method to access your medical records and communicate with your healthcare team. No matter where you are or what time of day it is, as long as you have internet access you can use my website
to view test results, schedule an appointment, or message your doctor, and much more
